Instructions:

1. Navigate to project folder in your terminal.
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `node index.js`

Prerequisites:
* Install the latest version of node.js

Things that I could of improved on with more time:
* Performance, there are a couple instances where I loop over larger sets of data multiple times. I could optimize the code to not do this.
* If this was a real ticket I'd speak to product about what I should do for zip codes that cross multiple state lines.
* Obviously each of these functions require thorough unit testing.
* I'd love to test this on a much larger data set.
* Some of the conditional statements are quite verbose.
* Console.log calls stdout internally but adds a newline. Depending on needs I could call stdout directly to avoid the trailing newline at the end of the results.
